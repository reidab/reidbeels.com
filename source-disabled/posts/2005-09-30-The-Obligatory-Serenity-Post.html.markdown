It's not as if this 
Serenity needs any more people blogging about it, but let's pretend for a moment that it does.  However, for the sake of the world at large, I'll try to keep this fairly short. If you haven't seen the movie, however, you should stop reading now because I'll probably talk about things that happen in it.

Having watched all of 
Firefly recently and having high expectations for the film, I will say that it did not disappoint. Fans of the series looking for a continuation and/or semi-conclusion will definitely find what they're looking for. The concern that I had when I first heard about the project was whether it could manage to stand apart from the series and appeal to the general moviegoing public. In this regard, I have mixed feelings.  The movie does a good job of quickly reviewing necessary backstory and introducing the core characters, but it fails in creating the amount of emotional attachment that fans of the series will bring with them. There's a big difference between a character dying when we've seen them for maybe ten minutes of the film and that same character dying with an entire series of character depth behind them. I fear that those unfamiliar with the universe will not understand the power and sadness of parts of the film, as they don't know the characters well enough to emphasize with them.
