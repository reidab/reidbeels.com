The last post on this blog was in October of 2007. I launched a new site then, with technologies designed to make things easier to update (which actually made it harder), and quickly abandoned it. That design was never really finished—blog posts weren't styled properly, things broke and were never fixed—and my [growing use of twitter](http://twitter.com/reidab) did a better job of providing the kind of community involvement that I'd been looking for.

Over the last few months, I've come to realize that I really do need a place to post my thoughts, ideas, and projects. I'm really excited by the things I'm involved in, and I have an urge to document, rant, and evangelize in more than 140 character chunks. And so, my friends, I launch this new site. The design may change at some point soon, but the important thing is that I have a place to put content again and that feels good. I'm also happy about the new [profile](/profile) page, which addresses the most common feedback I got about the old site (that there wasn't a way to contact me).

I'm kicking things off by chiming in with a late response to [a new years meme that Audrey started](http://dyepot-teapot.com/2008/12/08/the-current-state-of-me/). In 2008:

- **Did I earn a living?** For the most part, yes. I've been freelancing for several years now and there's always some ebb and flow involved. I've found that I need to learn how to better articulate exactly what I want to be hired to do. Having a wide skillset is great, but it can easily lead to job description creep.
- **Was I able to incubate new ideas?** The year was filled with new and interesting ideas. I'm building open source software, organizing events, and helping to make connections between communities. I've experimented a lot with the ways in which I work and collaborate with others. From [Calagator](http://calagator.org) code sprints, to hanging out with [makerlab](http://makerlab.org/) folks, I've found various forms of co-working to be incredibly enriching. I would have liked to spend more time working on some personal ventures (I own the domain names, why don't they magically have content?), but I'm pretty happy with how things turned out.
- **Did I grow in ways I wanted?** Indeed. I feel that I've learned an incredible amount in 2008, mainly by immersing myself working with new techniques and technologies. My work on [Calagator](http://calagator.org), for example, has brought me from knowing very little about [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) development to it being one of my primary sources of income. Further involvement in event planning—helping out with [WhereCampPDX](http://wherecamppdx.org), [Ignite Portland](http://igniteportland.com), [CyborgCamp](http://cyborgcamp.com), and the very exciting new [Open Source Bridge](http://opensourcebridge.org)—has taught me many things about what makes communities work.

In 2009, I'm trying to better manage the balance between my work and my side projects an. There's been talk of organizing a "How to keep your side projects from keeping you from getting paid" panel for Open Source Bridge along these lines. I'm also working to get more organized from a business perspective and figure out new income streams. So far (since I'm late at posting this, I can cheat) I've registered an LLC, set up a better billing infrastructure, and worked a bit on that job description creep problem.
