The first part of the week was spent feveris<span style="color: orange">h</span>ly hacking on 
[ePDX](http://epdx.org), my stab a<span style="color: orange">t</span> a directory of Portland's awesome tech community. I'd thrown in to demo/launch it at 
[Demolicious](http://demolicious.tv/) on Wednesday and there were a few and crucial features to add before then. Thanks to help from 
[Audrey](http://epdx.org/people/11) and 
[Igal](http://epdx.org/people/21), the site launched and now is home to nearly 100 people. If you do tech stuff in Portland, please add yourself, your friends, your company, the user groups you attend, and the projects you hack on. :)


If you're curious, in the rush to launch ePDX we added: a whole new search mechanism for adding new people, basic duplicate detection, versioning of models with change history and rollback (as a 
[reusable rails engine](https://github.com/igal/paper_trail_manager)), photo and logo uploads (with importing from linked social networks), random exclamations on error messages, access control, admin tools, and oodles of 
[sass code](http://sass-lang.com/).


After a couple of days of recovery, I spent all day and night on Saturday at 
[PIE](http://piepdx.com/) first chatting with some folks from Nike about an open data initiative and later attending the all-night 
[Red Hat Map Hack](http://calagator.org/events/1250459857).

At the map hack:

* Inspired by Audrey's current topic of text adventure games, I played a bit with 
[Inform](http://inform7.com/), logged in to 
[LambdaMOO](http://www.moo.mud.org/), and discussed the finer points of 
[Lost Pig (and place under ground)](http://www.grunk.org/lostpig/).


* I worked on fixing up and reviving 
[Don't Eat That!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/5049962228/in/photostream/), an app I built using 
[Geoloqi](http://geoloqi.com) a while back. There are still a couple of little things holding it back, but it should be in a functional state and up on GitHub soon.


* Audrey, Igal and I reviewed and deployed (yes!) some code Audrey and I had written to give Calagator 
[improved venue management features](http://calagator.org/venues). You can now 
[search for venues](http://calagator.org/venues?query=pie), add notes explaining how to access a space, and flag venues as 
[having public WiFi](http://calagator.org/venues?query=&wifi=1), or 
[being closed](http://calagator.org/venues/202390750).


* Igal and I worked on various aspects of ePDX. Then, at the last minute, Igal added a 
[creepy baby sloth](http://epdx.org/people/404please).


* Max Ogden, spinning in a chair, was 
[giffered](http://cl.ly/3c1A0Y113U3S2W0g1T25) and 
[interactively animatified](http://reidab.github.com/maxspin/).

Sunday was a day for relaxing, 
[processing photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/reidab/archives/date-posted/2011/03/06/), and remembering that I have a website.
