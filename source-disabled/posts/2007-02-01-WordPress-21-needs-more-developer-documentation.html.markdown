I installed WordPress 2.1 today, eager to make use of some of the new plugin features only to find that there isn't really any documentation on them. I'd like to echo the sentiment mentioned 
[here](http://ketsugi.com/panegyrist/wordpress-21-needs-more-developer-documentation/) and say that WordPress really does need stronger developer documentation. I want to be able to look to the documentation not to decrypt the innter workings of some new feature, but to get an idea of what is possible.
