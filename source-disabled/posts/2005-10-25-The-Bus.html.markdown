Looking out my window at the moment, I can see a number 77 TriMet bus stopped in the middle off the intersection of 19th and Northrup. Cars are making their way around it, but it's blocking the tracks of the portland streetcar.  The streetcar came up behind it and waited for a while before reversing back to the 18th and Northrup stop to let its passengers off. The bus looks pretty much empty, but a few more passengers just hopped off to join the streetcar refugees in their trek up the street.

TriMet maintainance just showed up and they appear to be snapping digital photos of the bus. I just went downstairs and looked around and I havea  better idea of what happened now. A few minutes before I noticed the stopped bus, I heard a clanking noise which I now assume was the black nissan that's parked on the corner running into the bus. One of the TriMet cops is talking to the driver now. The front bumper and the corner of the hood are dented, but there doesn't look to be to much overall damage (at least, no one inured). It would seem that the bus swerved to avoid the car, which is why it was diagonal in the intersection.
