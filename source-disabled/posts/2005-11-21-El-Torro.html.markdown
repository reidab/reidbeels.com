Just pulled out my viola for the first time in several years and, after a bit of time spent finding a way to make my computer play notes for me to tune against (and breaking the A string while tuning, though the note was flat when it broke so it was probably just because it was an old string), managed to pick out the viola part to El Torro in its entirety. Most memorizable song ever. Well, maybe ode to joy, starting on F# so you play the entire thing on the D string is easier, but that's cheating since it's just the super-simplified version of the song. I'm trying to remember, I think I played El Torro in... seventh grade? It might have been eighth. Definitely middle school. I know I'm not the only one who remembers it either, because the last time I remember playing through it was before a YSSO concert with Mandy and maybe Sarah (I know there was a cello, i just don't know who).

Anyway, I'm going to root around when I'm home over christmas break and see if I can find all of my viola music so that I can add "trying to remember how to play the viola" to my list of little things that I'm working on at the moment. I'm going to put it away now though because it's after midnight and if I keep this up I'll be far too tempted to move beyond light, light bowing and pizzicato and then my neighbors will get all displeased.
