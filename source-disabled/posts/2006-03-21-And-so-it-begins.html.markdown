The MAX train was right on time. 3:57 am on the dot. By the time it got to the airport, it was twenty minutes ahead of schedule. I picked up a steamer and a bagel and was surprised to find that the prices were the same as I would have paid outside of the airport. Security was fast. I barely had enough time to get my boarding pass and ID out of my pockets before it was my turn in line.

I sit now at my gate, E2, looking out the window at the 757 that will cary me on the first leg of my journey. The sky is dark now—the plane leaves at sunrise—and the runway lights are reflected on the wet tarmc. The chairs are comfortable enough and the internet access is free. Boarding begins in about five minutes.
