Yesterday I got the chance to head out to the 
[New York Hall of Science](http://www.nyscience.org/) hoping to gain inspiration from their signage for a museum project I'm working on. Their wayfinding system was effective, but didn't provide too much enlightenment. The museum offered a nice assortment of hand-on exhibits, many that I had seen elswhere (I think I was spoiled by 
[OMSI](http://www.omsi.org) and the 
[Exploratorium](http://exploratorium.org/) as a child).


[![Connections Sign](http://static.flickr.com/104/281036711_cff875ce13_m.jpg)](http://reidab.com/photos/photo/281036711/Connections_Sign.html)  By far the thing that stood out most to me was an exhibition called '
[Connections: The Nature of Networks](http://www.nyhallsci.org/nyhs-exhibits/e-connections_networks.html)'. It deals with many kinds of networks that exist in the world, from rivers to the internet, and the theories behind them. A bit of research shows that it was designed by 
[Jeff Kennedy Associates](http://www.jeffkennedyassociates.com) who has a fascinating (and probably internal) 
[site on the early development of the project](http://www.jeffkennedyassociates.com:16080/connections/concept/index.html).

I was quite impressed with the variety of networks that the exhibit managed to cover. You could see what happened when a break occurred in a power grid, scrub through video showing social interaction of various creatures, and visualize node interaction in a network of 
[ropes and pulleys](http://youtube.com/watch?v=eeeDvReDShA). Among the other geeky wonders showcased were 
[a giant version of Conway's Game of Life](http://reidab.com/photos/photo/281036818/Game_of_Life.html), 
[Internet Arm Wrestling](http://reidab.com/photos/photo/281036745/Internet_Arm_Wrestling.html), and a touchscreen 
[GIS viewer turned exhibit](http://reidab.com/photos/photo/281036777/Interactive_Map.html) showing the paths of subway, telephone, major roads and cable TV throughout Queens.

My personal favorite installation was a video processor that tracked the paths of visitors through the exhibition space (shown above). It wasn't the most accurate, but it did a pretty good job and definitely had that "wow, this is cool" factor. You could scrub through about 5 minutes of path history with a trackball and switch between the path-only view and a live video feed from the cameras above the space.

The first thing that came to mind after seeing this exhibition was a session at barcamp that I didn't get to go to but wish I had entitled "
[Spreading the Meme: How people get into hacking. How can we get get more to start?](http://mellory.blogspot.com/2006/09/barcamp-day-1.html)". Connections: The Nature of Networks seemed that it could be quite effective as a step towards this goal of getting kids interested in technology and networking.
