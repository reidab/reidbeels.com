![Coffee Time Exterior (Autumn Light)](http://reidab.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/2005-11-19.025.JPG)The yearly signs of Autumn have been popping up all over Portland in the last few weeks.  Brisk winds, fiery leaves, misty mornings, and a change of clocks all have heralded its arrival, but the final key element has only just recently dropped into place. Coffee Time has started serving hot apple cider.

I couldn't be happier. In my mind, apple cider just might be the most wonderfully perfect hot beverage ever to flow from the mugs of humanity. Just the spicy aroma of this amazing concoction is enough to warm the senses after a long walk in the biting wind. The taste is sweet, but not artificially so. Most of all, unlike so many other beverages in the world, cider has that fleeting texture that can only be obtained by mercilessly squeezing real fruit.

So here I sit, wrapped snugly in a sweater, sipping my cider, listening to the Duhks, gazing out at the early darkness, and wanting to grab some good friends and go on a hay ride.
