Snakes on a Plane. It's a movie. It's a phenomenon. It's a paradox. It's a lifestyle. What's it about? you ask. Well, let me try to explain. There are snakes. There is a plane. The plane is in the air. The snakes are on the plane. Presumably, chaos ensues. End of story. Oh, and it stars Samuel L. Jackson.

I remember reading about 
 when the entry on Josh Friedman's site had first been posted but I had no idea just how much of an online flurry there had been over the film until I rediscovered it the other night. This is an attempt to round up the many amusing gems that have been created.

There is, of course, the original 
[blog entry](http://hucksblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/snakes-on-motherfucking-plane.html) that's pretty much responsible for all of the hype this film's received online.

Next, and probably he second most influential piece of SoaP cannon, if you will, is this 
[interview with Samuel L. Jackson](http://collider.com/index.asp?aid=599&cid=9) that serves to assure the public that the film's title will not be changed from Snakes on a Plane if he has anything to do with it.

The comments on the 
[IMDB entry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417148/) contain over 200 possible titles for sequels, ranging from the clever to the terribly moronic.

It's been added to 
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_on_a_Plane) and 
[urban dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=snakes+on+a+plane). and spawned a 
[livejournal blog](http://www.livejournal.com/users/tongodeon/tag/snakes+on+a+plane) devoted to news and information about the film.  
[Two](http://topatoco.com/snakes.htm) 
[t-shirts](http://damnation-inc.com/order.php?item=1) have entered production, and last, but probably best of all, there's a humorous 
[audio trailer](http://www.subatomicwarp.com/Snakes_On_A_Plane.mp3) and 
[trailer script](http://www.yankeefog.com/archives/2005/08/snakes_on_a_pla_1.html). In more traditional online pre-movie hype, there are 
[actual photos](http://www.blackfilm.com/20050819/features/snakesonaplane.shtml) from the set, but that's boring compared to the rest of it.
