I'm working on a project to explain particle acceleration through design and interactivity. Using the 
[International Linear Collider](http://linearcollider.org/) as a model, I created diagrams for each step in a collision experiment. They're intended to help define a visual language for the project and will soon be animated and used as the basis for an interaction prototype.
