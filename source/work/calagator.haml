  [Calagator](http://calagator.org) is Portland's tech calendar â€” the place to find user group meetings and other tech-related events on any given night. It's also an [open source project](https://github.com/calagator/calagator), allowing anyone to create a calendar around their own community.

  I've been involved as a core developer and designer on Calagator since its inception in 2008 and provided many of the initial sketches and wireframes for the application.
