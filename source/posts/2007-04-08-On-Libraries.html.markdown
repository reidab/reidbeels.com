The fifteen branches of the Jackson County Library System closed today due to a lack of funding. I've spent countless hours both in the Ashland library and using its vast resources. I've known librarians for years who are now without jobs. This closure troubles me greatly.

*I ranted a bit over on 
[Metroblogging Portland](http://portland.metblogs.com/archives/2007/04/shhh_a_moment_o.phtml).

	
*There's a 
[measure on the May 15th ballot](http://www.sols-yes.org/) that people should vote for.

	
*The library has been maintaining an 
[informative blog](http://www.jcls.org/infoblog).

	
*The tribune has some decent 
[web coverage](http://www.mailtribune.com/special/libraries/).

	
*Elementary school students 
[staged a sit-in](http://www.dailytidings.com/2007/0407/stories/0407_library.php) at the closing of the Ashland branch.
