I haven't updated this site in a while, primarily because I'm in the middle of rethinking its design to work in some new contentful sections. Expect more frequent, and more interesting, updates in the future.

Since I moved to Portland, my mailbox has been flooded with credit card offers galore. Apparently when you only have one credit card and you pay it off on time, they like you. After about the first month of receiving them I stopped throwing them away and started keeping them, thinking that it would be interesting to find out which company was the greatest offender. This evening, back in Ashland, I came upon the cache of offers and sorted them out. Results follow.*20 - Captial One (They win the award for creativity in their packaging. There were at most four of any one envelope style and they ranged from standard envelopes to padded manila packages)


*14 - Chase Bank (12 of these were in identical envelopes)


*9 - Washington Mutual


*4 - American Express


*2 - Citi MasterCard


*3 - MasterCard


*2 - Delta SkyMiles AmEx (note: I didn't have a Delta SkyMiles account)


*2 - Shell


*1 - Texaco


*1 - First Financial Bank


*1 - US Bank**Total:**
 59
