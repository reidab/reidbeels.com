Inspired by, and based on, Harvey Ramer's 
[Autolink Attachment Plugin](http://blog.designdelineations.com/2006/05/17/wordpress-plugin-autolink-attachment/), this plugin lists attachments to a WordPress 2.x post in a list following the text. Only attachments that are not already linked to or displayed in the post text will be shown (this is mainly to prevent inline images from being listed).


Attachments are shown with an icon mapped to their file extension from Mark James' excellent 
[Silk icon set](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/). The attachment's title will be used for the link name and, if the attachment has a description, it will be shown below.


**Update Feb 7, 2007:**
 I've put together a new version that fixes the CSS typo (oops!), the post id issue Pete mentioned, and is now compatible with WP 2.1. There's also a version available that just fixes bugs for WP 2.0 users.
