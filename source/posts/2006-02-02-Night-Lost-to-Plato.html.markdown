After sitting in the Old Pharmacy Cafe for far too long this morning (a result of accidentally falling asleep at about nine), I think I've finally gotten at least a semblance of a handle on the project of mapping platonic dialogue Euthydemus. I keep thinking that I should be doing something more complex and elegant, but the sheer length and density of the dialogue leads me to the most concise representation possible. At the moment, I'm basically just linking together various series of conclusions that the participants of the dialogue jump to throughout the course of the text. I'd like to do this again with a shorter dialogue in a larger format so that the text and rhetoric could be put in context of the actual encounter. While they would obviously have to be estimated, metrics that correspond to perceived stress and anger would be fun to visualize.
