This widget displays your WordPress archive as a dropdown menu. It supports dates, categories, and tags (if UTW is installed). Dates can either be shown in the default WP format, or in a hierarchy. The widget title may be left blank to display the menu without a title. To see what this looks like in action (showing dates in a hierarchy and categories) take a look at the bottom of this page.
To install, just toss dropdown-archive.php into your wp-content/plugins directory, activate the plugin, and add the widget to your sidebar.
