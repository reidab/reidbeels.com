Soon after discovering that Le Happy (the créperie that I discussed 
[here](http://reidab.com/new/blog/2005/09/02/creperies-of-portland-le-happy/)) was a mere four blocks east of my apartment, I was somewhat amazed to run across 
another 
**two** crêpe joints just four blocks in the opposite direction. One is a small street stand that bathes in the steady flow of shoppers along the main section of NW 23rd.  The second lies the 
other direction on 23rd, in an area that many first-timers to the area don't think to discover (or, at least, I didn't discover it until I was moved here and out exploring).  It is at this, much larger and less street-standy location that I had dinner this evening.

Visage is, like so many other things in the area, located in a converted old victorian house and comes across more as a coffee shop than anything else.  Despite this appearance, I was not disappointed. I sampled a simple savory breakfast crêpe filled with egg, ham, and mozzarella which was well-prepared and quite tasty. When it arrived, I was surprised to find it criss-crossed with a drizzling of plain yogurt.  This raised flags of suspicion, as it was unexpected, but had won me over completely within the first two bites. The contrast of the chilled yogurt against the warm fillings leant an air of freshness to the crêpe that was quite enjoyable.
