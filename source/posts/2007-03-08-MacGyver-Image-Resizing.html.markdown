You've got 15 seconds to take a screenshot and resize it for use in a post, a Mac with a clean OS install, and a paper clip. You double click the file on the desktop and up pops your image in Preview.  That's no good, Preview can't resize images... or can it?Even though Preview doesn't seem to allow you to resize an image, it can be done. Just zoom out a few steps or resize the window (Preview will fit the image to the window by default) and fire off a quick command-shift-4. That's right: 
take a screenshot of the screenshot. Then, just open the new screenshot (the metascreenshot, if you will), save it in your preferred format, and upload away!


p.s. If you're a little more patient and want a lot more power, there's always the incredibly awesome
