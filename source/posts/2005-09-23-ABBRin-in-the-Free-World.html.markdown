While working on this redesign here, I'm finding myself reading a bunch of articles and reference sites that I hadn't paid attention to for years.  One thing that I've just rediscovered is the joy of the 
ABBR tag.  It lets you markup abbreviations so that they can be styled if you're so inclined but the thing that is cool about it in my mind is that browsers display the title attribute of it as a tooltip.  I kind of went crazy marking up the post that I just made and I'm determined to keep doing it so that those who don't know what 
KOL,  
ZP, or 
PNCA are can be easily enlightened with a simple mouseover.

After writing this post, I realized that for most of my examples I should have been using the ACRONYM tag instead.  Oops, silly me.
