After she saw it as part of the 
[New York Musical Theatre Festival](http://www.nymf.org/), Talia sent me a link to the website of 
[Gutenberg: The Musical](http://www.gutenbergthemusical.com/). Ever since I downloaded and listened to the music, some part of it has been stuck in my head constantly.

The show is an amusing, though wildly and 
[proudly](http://www.gutenbergthemusical.com/index.php?content=gutenberg) historically incorrect, show that centers around Gutenberg's invention of the printing press. With witty lyrics set to incredibly catchy tunes, and a total running time of only 22 minutes, I highly reccomend that everyone 
[download](http://www.gutenbergthemusical.com/index.php?content=music) and listen to this little gem of a show.

The plot centers around Johan Gutenberg (of course), Helvetica Guminstipple, the illiterate grape juice stomper that loves him, and an evil monk that wants the press destroyed so that he can maintain the fact that "the bible sez whatever I sez it sez". It's beautiful.
